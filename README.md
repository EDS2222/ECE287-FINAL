# HexGravJump
HexGravJump is a semi-platformer that draws inspiration from games like Gravity Guy and JOSH-Jump. In this game, players navigate through obstacles by toggling the gravity switch, allowing for upward and downward orientation. Similar to the mechanics found in the Gravity Guy and JOSH-Jump projects [click here](https://github.com/HuIsJason/J.O.S.H.-Jump/blob/master/josh_jump.v) ,The game is a Hex verion, inviting players to enjoy the simple mechanics of gravity control to successfully navigate through the obstacles.
